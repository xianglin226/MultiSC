# scNEAT
scNEAT is a pipeline to analyze NEAT-seq data containing five analyses:  
1) Clustering NEAT-seq data by using scHCAE  
2) Target prediction of TFs by using scMF 
3) Cell-type specific DE analysis  
4) Regression analysis to detect confident target genes of TFs
5) Regression analysis to detect co-target genes of two TFs.
